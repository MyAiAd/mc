# Status Constraint Fix Summary

## ✅ Problem Resolved

The **check constraint violation** for the `import_logs` status field has been fixed! 

## 🎯 Root Cause

The database table has a **check constraint** that only allows these status values:
- `'pending'`
- `'processing'`
- `'completed'`
- `'failed'`

But the code was trying to send `status: 'success'` which **violated the constraint**.

## 🔧 Fix Applied

Added **status mapping** in the `createImportLog` function:

```javascript
// Map status to valid database values
const validStatus = status === 'success' ? 'completed' : 
                   status === 'failed' ? 'failed' : 
                   status === 'error' ? 'failed' : 
                   'pending';
```

This automatically converts:
- ✅ `'success'` → `'completed'`
- ✅ `'failed'` → `'failed'` 
- ✅ `'error'` → `'failed'`
- ✅ anything else → `'pending'`

## 🎉 Expected Results

Now when you test the import functionality:

✅ **No more check constraint violations**
✅ **Import logs created successfully**
✅ **Status displays correctly** as "completed" for successful imports
✅ **All import operations work** without database errors

## 🧪 Test Again

1. **Go to Data Import page**
2. **Run "Import All GHL Data"**
3. **Check console** - should see:
   ```
   📝 Creating import log with data: {status: 'completed', ...}
   ✅ Import log created successfully: {...}
   ```
4. **No more 400 Bad Request errors!**
