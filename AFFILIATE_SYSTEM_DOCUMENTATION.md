# Multi-Level Affiliate System Documentation

## Overview

This documentation covers the complete multi-level affiliate management system built to replace GoAffPro. The system implements a 3-level commission structure with Go High Level (GHL) as the primary signup source, while consolidating data from multiple platforms including MightyNetworks, Shopify, and existing GoAffPro data.

## System Architecture

### Core Objectives
- **Replace GoAffPro entirely** within 3-4 weeks
- **Multi-level structure**: Level 1 (direct), Level 2 (indirect), Level 3 (grand referrals)
- **Primary signup source**: Go High Level (GHL)
- **Data consolidation**: Import from GHL, MightyNetworks, Shopify, and GoAffPro
- **Shopify-centric**: Shopify as the pillar system for order processing
- **Retroactive commissions**: New rates apply to existing orders

## Commission Structure

Based on the provided commission table:

| Product Category | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
|------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Coaching Program | 20%     | 5%      | 2%      |
| Affiliate Software | 40%   | 10%     | 5%      |
| Mastermind       | 30%     | 8%      | 3%      |
| Default          | 15%     | 5%      | 2%      |

✅ **IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED** - Commission levels are fully set up and operational.

### Current Commission Plans (As Per Jennaz's Requirements)

| Product Category | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Status |

### Implementation Details

**Database Configuration:**
- All commission plans stored in `commission_plans` table
- Commission rates exactly match provided specifications
- Multi-level commission calculation fully automated
- Database functions handle L1/L2/L3 commission distribution

**Verification Status:**
- ✅ 8 commission plans total configured
- ✅ All 7 required products have exact commission rates

- Updates affiliate earnings in real-time

**Admin Management Interface:**
- `src/pages/CommissionPlans.tsx` provides full commission plan management
- View, edit, and add new commission plans
- Toggle active/inactive status
- Real-time commission structure overview

**Testing & Validation:**
- `test-commission-plans.js` script validates all commission plans
- Confirms rates match exact requirements
- Tests commission calculation functions
- Verifies database integrity

**Product Category Mapping:**
```sql
-- Function to get commission plan for any product
get_commission_plan_for_product(product_name, product_category)

-- Usage examples:
- 'Bae' → 20%/10%/5%
- 'REACTION CBD' → 15%/5%/5%

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
1. **Team Statistics**: Pre-calculated metrics in `affiliate_system_users`
2. **Materialized Views**: `team_statistics` table for complex queries
3. **Indexed Queries**: Strategic indexes on frequently accessed columns

### Database Indexes
```sql
-- Affiliate lookups
idx_affiliate_system_users_email
idx_affiliate_system_users_referral_code
idx_affiliate_system_users_ghl_contact_id

-- Referral tree navigation
idx_referral_relationships_l1_referrer
idx_referral_relationships_l2_referrer
idx_referral_relationships_l3_referrer

-- Commission queries

### ✅ Race Condition Fixes - IMPLEMENTED

**Issue Resolved:** Application loading screen freeze and infinite loops  
**Solution:** Consolidated authentication state management  

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **🔄 Consolidated useEffect hooks**: Single effect prevents race conditions
2. **⏱️ Enhanced debouncing**: Increased from 2 to 3 seconds for stability
3. **🚫 Loading state protection**: Prevents overlapping data refresh requests
4. **📝 Detailed logging**: Request IDs track all operations for debugging
5. **⚠️ Data integrity warnings**: Alerts when good data might be replaced

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Before: Two separate useEffect hooks caused race conditions
useEffect([dataSource, authLoading]) // Data source changes
useEffect([authLoading])             // Auth state changes

// After: Single consolidated useEffect prevents conflicts
useEffect([dataSource, authLoading]) // Handles both triggers safely
```

**Monitoring Recommendations:**
- Browser console shows detailed request logging
