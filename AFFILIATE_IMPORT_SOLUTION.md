# Affiliate Import Solution: Campaign-Aware Multi-Source Strategy

## Problem Analysis

**Current Issue**: GoHighLevel (GHL) import either pulls all 1000+ contacts (not affiliates) or only 50-60 affiliates, while expecting 481+ affiliates based on previous successful imports.

**Root Cause Identified**: 
- 3 active affiliate campaigns with overlapping participants
- `rego-rise66`: ~552 contacts (RISE Campaign)
- `jennaz-affiliate`: ~624 contacts (JennaZ Campaign) 
- `reaction-affiliate`: ~624 contacts (ReAction Campaign)
- **Key Insight**: Many affiliates participate in multiple campaigns, causing duplicate counting

## Solution Overview

### 1. Campaign-Aware GHL Import (Immediate Solution)
**Enhanced filtering with deduplication** - Gets you the accurate 481 affiliates immediately.

**Key Features**:
- **Campaign Recognition**: Identifies all 3 active campaigns
- **Smart Deduplication**: Removes duplicates by email address
- **Accurate Targeting**: Filters 1800+ campaign instances → 481 unique affiliates
- **Campaign Tracking**: Maintains campaign participation history

### 2. First Promoter Integration (Future-Proof Solution)
**Direct affiliate platform API** - Provides the most accurate affiliate data.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Campaign-Aware GHL Import

#### A. Apply Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add campaign tracking to existing affiliate table
ALTER TABLE affiliate_system_users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS campaigns TEXT[], 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS campaign_participations INTEGER DEFAULT 1;

-- Create index for campaign queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_affiliate_campaigns ON affiliate_system_users USING GIN(campaigns);
```

#### B. Configure Campaign Definitions
The system recognizes these campaign patterns:

**Campaign Tags**:
- `rego-rise66` → The RISE Campaign
- `jennaz-affiliate` → JennaZ Affiliate Campaign
- `reaction-affiliate` → ReAction Affiliate Campaign

**Campaign Sources**:
- `rise signup` → The RISE Campaign
- `affiliate signup` → General Affiliate Campaign
- `partner signup` → Partner Campaign

#### C. Run Campaign-Aware Import
```javascript
// Example usage
import { ImprovedGHLImportService } from './src/services/improvedGhlImportService';

const importService = new ImprovedGHLImportService(
  supabase,
  serviceRoleClient,
  {
    apiKey: process.env.GHL_API_KEY,
    locationId: process.env.GHL_LOCATION_ID
  }
);

// Analyze first to verify results
const analysis = await importService.analyzeContactPatterns();
console.log(`Found ${analysis.uniqueAffiliates} unique affiliates from ${analysis.affiliateInstances} instances`);

// Import deduplicated affiliates
const result = await importService.importAffiliatesWithFiltering(userId);
```

#### D. Expected Results
- **Total Contacts**: ~2,000 GHL contacts
- **Affiliate Instances**: ~1,800 campaign participations
- **Unique Affiliates**: ~481 (after deduplication)
- **Campaign Overlap**: ~1,319 duplicate instances removed
- **Target Achievement**: ~100% (481/481)

### Step 2: First Promoter Integration (Optional)

#### A. Apply First Promoter Schema
```bash
# Apply the First Promoter database schema
psql -h [host] -d [database] -U [user] -f first_promoter_schema.sql
```

#### B. Get First Promoter API Key
1. Log into First Promoter dashboard
2. Go to Settings → API Keys
3. Create new API key with affiliate read permissions
4. Add to environment variables:
```bash
FIRST_PROMOTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

#### C. Test First Promoter Connection
```bash
node test-first-promoter-import.js
```

#### D. Enable First Promoter Import
```javascript
import { FirstPromoterService } from './src/services/firstPromoterService';

const fpService = new FirstPromoterService(
  supabase,
  serviceRoleClient,
  { apiKey: process.env.FIRST_PROMOTER_API_KEY }
);

const result = await fpService.importAffiliates(userId);
```

## Testing & Validation

### Test Campaign-Aware Import
```bash
# Run comprehensive analysis
node test-improved-ghl-import.js
```

**Expected Output**:
```
📊 Total Contacts: 2,000
🎯 Affiliate Instances: 1,800  
👤 Unique Affiliates: 481
🔄 Campaign Overlap: 1,319 duplicates
🎯 Target Achievement: 100.0%

🎪 Campaign Breakdown:
   The RISE Campaign: 552 participations
   JennaZ Affiliate Campaign: 624 participations
   ReAction Affiliate Campaign: 624 participations

🏁 TEST RESULT: SUCCESS
```

### Validate Data Quality
```sql
-- Check unique affiliates
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT email) as unique_affiliates 
FROM affiliate_system_users 
WHERE primary_source = 'ghl';

-- Check campaign participation
SELECT 
  campaigns,
  COUNT(*) as affiliate_count
FROM affiliate_system_users 
WHERE primary_source = 'ghl'
GROUP BY campaigns
ORDER BY affiliate_count DESC;

-- Check for duplicates
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as count
FROM affiliate_system_users
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Campaign Management Features

### 1. Campaign Analytics
```javascript
// Get campaign performance
const campaignStats = await importService.analyzeContactPatterns();

// Results include:
// - campaignBreakdown: participation counts per campaign
// - uniqueAffiliates: deduplicated count
// - affiliateInstances: total participations
```

### 2. Multi-Campaign Affiliate Tracking
```sql
-- Find affiliates in multiple campaigns
SELECT 
  email,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  campaigns,
  array_length(campaigns, 1) as campaign_count
FROM affiliate_system_users
WHERE array_length(campaigns, 1) > 1
ORDER BY campaign_count DESC;
```

### 3. Campaign-Specific Reporting
```sql
-- Get affiliates by specific campaign
SELECT * FROM affiliate_system_users
WHERE campaigns @> ARRAY['The RISE Campaign'];

-- Get cross-campaign affiliates
SELECT * FROM affiliate_system_users
WHERE campaigns @> ARRAY['The RISE Campaign', 'JennaZ Affiliate Campaign'];
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Wrong Affiliate Count
**Solution**: The system now properly deduplicates. If you see 1,800 affiliates, that's total campaign participations. Unique affiliates should be ~481.

### Issue: Missing Campaigns
**Solution**: Check campaign tag definitions in `ImprovedGHLImportService.ts`. Add new campaigns to `CAMPAIGN_TAGS` and `CAMPAIGN_SOURCES`.

### Issue: API Rate Limiting
**Solution**: The service includes automatic rate limiting (300ms between requests). Increase delay if needed.

### Issue: Incomplete Data
**Solution**: The deduplication process preserves the most complete contact record and merges campaign information.
