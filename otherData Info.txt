Great! So the Data Sync page, at the bottom, in a section called "API Configuration Status" shows this section:


GoAffPro API
Required environment variables:

GOAFFPRO_API_KEY
GOAFFPRO_BASE_URL

GHL API
Required environment variables:

GHL_API_KEY
GHL_LOCATION_ID

But I cannot tell if you are alerting me to the fact they have not yet been added or if I am meant to see them reflected there.

Meanwhile.. here is some key data (below). I have not confirmed if the Supabase data is a match to what we have (I think it is) but the others in the list I do not know if you have seen them. Will this help us to resolve the Data Sync question I have?

VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>
VITE_GOAFFPRO_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_GOAFFPRO_ACCESS_TOKEN>
VITE_GOAFFPRO_PUBLIC_TOKEN=<YOUR_GOAFFPRO_PUBLIC_TOKEN>
MIGHTY_NETWORKS_ZAPIER=<YOUR_MIGHTY_NETWORKS_ZAPIER>


GHL Location API Key
<YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>

GHL Location ID
<YOUR_GHL_LOCATION_ID>
