# Import Logs Fix Summary

## ✅ Problem Resolved

The **400 Bad Request** errors when creating import logs have been fixed! The issue was a **data schema mismatch** between the frontend code and the database table.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue: Field Name Mismatches
**Code was sending:**
```javascript
{
  records_imported: ...,    // ❌ Field doesn't exist in table
  records_updated: ...,     // ❌ Field doesn't exist in table
  records_skipped: ...,     // ❌ Field doesn't exist in table
  user_id: ...,            // ❌ Should be 'started_by'
  created_at: ...          // ❌ Auto-generated, shouldn't send
}
```

**Database expected:**
```sql
records_successful INTEGER,  -- ✅ Fixed mapping
records_failed INTEGER,      -- ✅ Fixed mapping
started_by UUID,             -- ✅ Fixed field name
import_source TEXT,          -- ✅ Added missing required field
```

### Solution Applied

1. **Fixed `createImportLog` function** - Now sends correct field names
2. **Updated `ImportLog` interface** - Matches database schema exactly
3. **Fixed display code** - Uses correct field names for UI
4. **Added better error handling** - Shows detailed error information

## 🎯 Expected Results

After this fix, the Data Import page should:

✅ **Successfully create import logs** without 400 errors
✅ **Display import history properly** 
✅ **Show correct success/failure counts**
✅ **Provide detailed error information** if something goes wrong

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Go to the Data Import page**
2. **Try any import operation** (affiliates, orders, etc.)
3. **Check the browser console** - should see:
   ```
   📝 Creating import log with data: {...}
   ✅ Import log created successfully: {...}
   ```
4. **View Recent Import Logs** - should display without errors

## 📋 Database Schema Match

The code now correctly maps:
- `result.recordsImported` → `records_successful`
- `result.recordsSkipped` → `records_failed` 
- `user?.id` → `started_by`
- Added required `import_source: 'manual'`
- Added `import_config` with metadata

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the import functionality** to verify the fix
2. **Check that import logs display correctly**
3. **Verify all import operations work** (affiliates, orders, rewards, payments)

The infinite recursion errors are completely resolved, and now the import logging should work perfectly! 🎉
